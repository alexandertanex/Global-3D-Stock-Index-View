# Global-3D-Stock-Index-View

For a more detailed description about the project, refer to the report.

## Overview
This project introduces an innovative 3D interactive globe designed to transform the visualization of financial data. Moving beyond traditional 2D methods, it offers a dynamic and immersive experience to explore global financial indices with enhanced spatial awareness, using orthographic projection and D3.js technologies.

## Features
The interactive globe allows users to manipulate a virtual world to see how regional events affect global economies, with financial performance highlighted through varying color intensities. This intuitive approach helps users grasp complex financial interactions and market dynamics easily.

## How It Works
The visualization integrates detailed geographic and financial data from comprehensive JSON datasets. Users can rotate, zoom, and drag the globe, as well as use a temporal slider to track market trends over time. The tool is designed for easy local setup and can be run using Visual Studio Code with Live Server, facilitating both detailed analysis and broader overviews.

## Practical Applications
Ideal for financial analysts and data enthusiasts, the tool enables detailed analysis of the impacts of major global events, like the COVID-19 pandemic, on financial markets. The visualization's color coding aids in understanding market trends at a glance, providing insights into economic repercussions during crucial periods.

## Future Enhancements
Future updates aim to expand the range of indices covered, incorporate real-time data, and introduce additional interactive features such as detailed data view on hover and comparative analysis of multiple indices at once.


## How to Run It Locally
